Instead of generating a random whole number between zero and a given number like we did before, we can generate a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.

To do this, we'll define a minimum number min and a maximum number max.

Create a function called randomRange that takes a range myMin and myMax and returns a random whole number that's greater than or equal to myMin, and is less than or equal to myMax, inclusive.


return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1)) + myMin;


*/

function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {
    // Only change code below this line
    return 0;
    // Only change code above this line
  }



// Solution
return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1)) + myMin;
