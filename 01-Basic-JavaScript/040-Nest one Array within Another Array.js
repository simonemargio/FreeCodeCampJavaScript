You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.
Create a nested array called myArray.

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [];


// Solution
const myArray = [["Simone", 1], ["Sol", 2]];
