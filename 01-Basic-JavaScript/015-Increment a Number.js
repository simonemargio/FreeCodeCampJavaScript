You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;
is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.
Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.

*/

let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;

// Solution
let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar++;
